# MCPE.AlphaServer

This is a Minecraft Pocket Edition server targeted for MinecraftPE Alpha v0.8.1.

The goal is to replace/provide a better documented alternative PocketMine, as it was made in PHP with little understanding of how the internals actually work.

# ! This is very much a work in progress, the only thing it's capable of is handling player connections/movements.

## I will try to update it when I can, however there's little free time as I am busy with university and my day job.
